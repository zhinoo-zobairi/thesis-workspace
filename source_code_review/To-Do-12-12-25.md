### To-Do List for the next 2 weeks:
```
1. http body events and the http inspector (Week 1)
2. Quell Code von Max über IPv6 Plugin (Week 2)
3. Meeting und Fragen stellen (After 2 weeks)
4. Diskutieren, welche MQTT Events an das Model schicken (At meeting)
```

## Week 1: HTTP inspector structure (Days 1-7)

| Day | Focus | Files to read | Goal |
|-----|-------|---------------|------|
| **1** | Inspector registration | `http_api.h/.cc`, `http_inspect.h/.cc` | How an inspector is plugged into Snort |
| **2** | Per-flow state | `http_flow_data.h/.cc`, `http_transaction.h/.cc` | How state is tracked per connection |
| **3** | Stream splitter | `http_stream_splitter.h/.cc` | How TCP bytes become protocol messages |
| **4** | Message sections | `http_msg_section.h/.cc`, `http_msg_body.h/.cc` | How parsed data is modeled |
| **5** | Body events | `http_body_event.h`, `http_request_body_event.h/.cc` | How body data is published |
| **6** | ML consumer | `snort_ml_inspector.cc` | How events are consumed |
| **7** | Review | Notes | Consolidate, write questions |

---

## Week 2: Max's IPv6 Plugin (Days 8-14)

| Day | Focus | Action |
|-----|-------|--------|
| **8-10** | Study IPv6 plugin code | Understand real plugin structure |
| **11-12** | Compare HTTP vs IPv6 | Note patterns and differences |
| **13-14** | Prepare for meeting | Questions list, unclear points |

---

## After 2 weeks: Meeting

- Discuss MQTT plugin requirements
- Decide which MQTT events go to ML model
- Begin MQTT plugin design

---

## Key pattern to understand

```
HTTP Inspector → HttpMsgBody → HttpRequestBodyEvent → ML inspector
```

Later:

```
MQTT Inspector → MqttPublish → MqttPayloadEvent → ML inspector
```
