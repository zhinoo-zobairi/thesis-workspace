# Literature Review – My Learning Log

## Pillars of my research question:
>“Erkennen von Zero-Day Attacks in IoT-Netzen – Erweiterung von SnortML um einen MQTT-Inspector.”

**Translated conceptually:**

>*Detection of zero-day attacks in IoT networks + Extending SnortML with an MQTT Inspector.*
- *What*: **detect** zero-day attacks
- *Where*: in **IoT networks**
- *How*: by **extending SnortML**
- *Why*: because SnortML currently handles **only HTTP**, but IoT commonly uses MQTT

## Collections
- [MQTT Security](01_mqtt_security_and_attacks.md)
- [ML-based IDS](02_ml_based_ids.md)
- [SnortML Architecture](03_snort_and_snortml.md)
- [Evaluation Methods](04_evaluation_metrics_and_datasets.md)

## Progress Log
| Week | Papers | Focus | Key Takeaway |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Schrötter et al. | Neural-Network vs Rule-based IDS | Neural IDSs show strong results in controlled datasets but they collapse in realistic conditions |
| 2 | ? | ? | ? |
